# image-prediction

This project demonstrates how to classify images of animals, birds, and other categories using pre-trained models with TensorFlow. It leverages powerful pre-trained models to perform high-accuracy predictions on various image datasets.

TensorFlow: An open-source machine learning framework used for building and deploying machine learning models.

Pre-trained Models: Utilizes models like MobileNet, InceptionV3, and ResNet for transfer learning to classify images.

Keras: High-level API for TensorFlow, used for building and training deep learning models.

NumPy: Library for numerical computations, used for handling image data.

Pillow: Python Imaging Library for image processing tasks.

OpenCV: For image pre-processing and manipulation.

Jupyter Notebooks: For interactive development and visualization.
